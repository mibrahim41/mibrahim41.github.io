Biography
========

I am an ML PhD candidate at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I work as part of the Predictive Analytics & Intelligent Systems (PAIS) lab, and I am advised by Prof. Nagi Gebraeel. I was also a member of NASA's Habitat Optimized for Missions of Exploration - Space Technology Research Institute (HOME STRI).

My research focuses on the intersection of Federated Learning (FL) and Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to develop scalable and robust distributed learning frameworks for a range of engineering problems. One of my objectives is to develop novel models for various learning tasks that are robust to any noise present in the features or labels of the training data. I also work on developing novel federated training algorithms to train these models in a distributed fashion without moving data, thereby ensuring privacy and minimizing communication costs. While my research is mainly motivated by industrial fault discovery, detection, and diagnosis problems, all the novel models and algorithms I have developed are generic and applicable to a wide range of domains, including healthcare and cybersecurity.

Hobbies & Interests
========
Besides research, I really enjoy car photography ðŸ“· (monthly visits to cars & coffe events), playing racket sports with my friends ðŸŽ¾ (squash is my favorite, even if I'm not great at it), reading ðŸ“– (especially horror novels), and taking long walks on campus ðŸŒ³ (although the Atlanta heat can make it difficult sometimes).
