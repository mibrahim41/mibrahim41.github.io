I am an ML PhD candidate at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I work as part of the Predictive Analytics & Intelligent Systems (PAIS) lab, and I am advised by Prof. Nagi Gebraeel. I was also a member of NASA's Habitat Optimized for Missions of Exploration - Space Technology Research Institute (HOME STRI).

My research focuses on the intersection of Federated Learning (FL) and Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to develop scalable and robust distributed learning programs for a wide array of business and engineering problems. My objective is to develop novel models for a range of different learning tasks that are robust to any noise present in the features or labels of the training data. I also work on developing novel federated training algorithms to train these models in a distributed fashion without moving data to ensure privacy and minimize communication costs. While my research is mainly motivated by fault discovery, detection, and diagnosis problems in industrial settings, all the novel models and algorithms I have developed are generic and applicable to a wide range of domains, including healthcare and cybersecurity.
